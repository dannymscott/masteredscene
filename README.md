Unity scene submission for the Mastered Technical Art Bootcamp

Welcome to my Mastered Technical Art Bootcamp project. This is a simple scene that I put together as a demonstration for a set of technical art deliverables. These include animation, visual effects, materials and 
a collection of scripts. The scene includes a basic first person player controller that cannot jump. You can use WASD or the arrow keys to navigate the scene. You can also change the time of day using 1, 2 and 3 and 
quick travel to some key locations within the scene using 4, 5 and 6. The deliverables required for this project are as followed:

Animation - Sundial rotation made using the Unity animator
Visual Effects - Leaves falling from the trees, magic particles orbiting around the sundial
Materials - Moving grass shader, water shader, cloud skybox shader
Custom Editor Tool - Texture Import Processor that automatically assigns texture presets
